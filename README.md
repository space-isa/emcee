# Motivation

The emcee package, a pure-Python tool developed for Bayesian statistical analysis, is widely used in the astronomy community (see documentation in **Credits** to learn more). I will provide notebooks I used to get started, as well as the Python package I develop as part of my thesis project studying properties of gamma ray burst afterglow outflows from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. 

# About the code

Jupyter notebooks can be downloaded and used to follow along with the emcee tutorial, as well as to practice with fake data. The included emcee afterglow parameter estimation code is not currently included with an afterglow model. I will be updating the code in the future so that it can be run using BOXFIT, a freely-available afterglow code. 

# How to use

Jupyter notebooks: Explore! Intended as learning tools. \
Emcee afterglow code: Go to /emcee_afterglow_parameter_estimation/docs and read the README file for instructions on how to use.
